Will be realising this plugin in chrome web store soon.

Helps you get all the video's from your current ted talks page.

Supports url's having the following formats:

a) http://www.ted.com
b) http://www.ted.com/talks.*

Note: It takes some time to get all the talk video links. So, please be patient.

Usage:
Once the video links are display you can click on them for download or copy those links to a Download Manager for bulk download. This bulk download feature will be available in this extension in future.
